### UI Design

**Affordance** - Thing in the environment that you can act with.  Door handles, etc.

In design, it's what you can do.  Buttons, form fields, etc

**Flows** - Chains of affordances that allow things to happen

Designing flows and affordances is the important part

Domain Experience -> Situations -> Flows -> Affordances -> 2D Layout
