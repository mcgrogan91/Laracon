# Jason McCreary - YAGNI With Laravel

### You aren't gonna need it

Implement things when you actually need them, never when you just forsee that you need them. - Ron Jeffries

Don't over-engineer.  We tend to add complexity that isn't needed

Do you **really** need to build it **right** now?

Do you have **everything** you need to start?

### Stages of YAGNI

1. Laziness
    * It can almost be infuriating to not build things
2. Empowerment
    * Don't just say no to everything
    * Don't call YAGNI when...
        * Learning something new
        * Current design decision based on a future need (You can build for the future without over-engineering)
        * Testing
        * Abstracting external code
        * Business requirements
3. Confidence
    * Knowing when to defer decisions until tomorrow
    * Trusting your ability to pivot quickly
    * Writing less code
    * Writing less complex code
