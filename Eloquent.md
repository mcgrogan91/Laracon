# Colin DeCarlo - Keeping Eloquent Eloquent

@colindecarlo

Having the correct tools is not the same as using the tools correctly

Default model attributes - Setting the attributes array is useful for having model values on instantiation

"Don't be afraid to use the source"

Use scopes to define more meaningful relationships

### Reports

Eloquent ORM isn't great for reports

Report Manager - abstract class that uses DB Manager.  This keeps ugly report code out of your controllers
