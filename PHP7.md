# Zeev Suraski - PHP 7

@zeevs

## The PHP 7 Story

Updated memory management

Large performance gains - over 2x speedup from 5.6 in benchmarks

EngineException - more catchable exceptions

Return types - Scalar type hints

assert is not a language construct (zend.assertions) - zero impact if turned off

Null coalesce -> ($x ?? $y) -> better performance than ternary

### Going Forward

7.1 is feature complete - expect early next year

(Faster than 7.0 by ~5% in real world apps!)
